1) How do you use the SQLite command-line client to open a database? (What is the console command?)

sqlite3 dataBaseName.sqlite.db

2) What does the .schema command do?

The .schema command shows the CREATE statement for a table(s)

3) What dot-commands tell the SQLite command-line client to display data in columns, and with the column headers displayed?

.mode column
.headers on

4) What does a SELECT statement do?

The SELECT statement is used to query data from a database

5) What does the * symbol mean in a SELECT statement?

The * in the SELECT statement means to select all fields

6) Consider the end of Step 4. Should the query change? Why or why not?

If sqlite can still read the file, the physical file format would not matter. The query wouldnâ€™t need to change because sqlite is a dbms; you do not directly interact with the database, all database interactions are handled through the dbms.

7) What does an INSERT statement do?

The INSERT statement is used to create(add) data in a database. 

8) What does a WHERE clause in an UPDATE statement do?

The WHERE clause specifies which entry(row) to manipulate. If the WHERE clause is absent, every row is changed. 

9) What is the most important thing to remember about a DELETE statement?

You need to specify WHERE the row is you want to DELETE. If you do not, you will delete all rows in the table.
